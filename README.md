## Description
A simple application that searches the Googlebooks api using input from the user for up to ten displayed books. It allows the user to view an image, title and description of those books, alongside a link to the googlebooks website allowing the user to purchase the book if willing. Further, the user may sign up and log in with encrypted password details allowing them to save books to their account for future viewing. This could be a good way to store a list of 'wishlist' books, in which the user may want to read eventually.
